## Overview

![screenshot](./work-screenshot.png)

1.  My demo can be seen by following this [link](https://sports-app-rinon.netlify.app/)
1.  Some experience:
  - Building an existing website called sports App. This is actually the homepage without any menu in the header. Working on multiple backgrounds and adjusting their sizes to the container is the most important skill that I get out of this project.

1.   What I have learned and improved:
  - Learning how to use fonts faces, working on multiple backgrounds and adjusting their sizes to their container.

1. Wisdom to share:
The best way to improve is to be motivated and always confident to face challenges no matter how difficult it will be.
